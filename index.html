<!-- NAMI -->
<section class="cat-section">
    <h2>Nami 🤍🐈‍⬛</h2>
    <div class="photos">

    </div>
    <p>
        Nami is a calm and loving cat who has been around since the day I arrived. 💕<br>
        He never caused trouble, and it’s easy to see why he is loved so much by his owner. <br>
        He’s cute, gentle, and has his years already — it's impossible not to love him. 🥺🐾

<!-- NAGI -->
<section class="cat-section">
    <h2>Nagi 🧡🐱</h2>
    <div class="photos">
        <img src="img/nagi.jpg" alt="Nagi">
        <img src="img/nagi-.....jpg" alt="Nagi">
    </div>
    <p>
        I was there when Nagi first came home, tiny and playful like a little baby. 🍼💛<br>
        She has always been adorable, full of energy, and sweet since the first day I saw her. <br>
        She still brings joy just by being herself. 🌸🐈

<!-- CHIPS -->
<section class="cat-section">
    <h2>Chips 😺🧡</h2>
    <div class="photos">
        <img src="img/sleepy chips.jpg" alt="Chips">
        <img src="img/chips....jpg" alt="Chips">
    </div>
    <p>
        Chips is a ginger cat that was given to Jay by me, and I love him just as much as my other cats. 💛🐾<br>
        He was separated from his mother and two brothers, and ever since then I’ve had a soft spot for him. <br>
        When I visit and see Chips, I love spending time playing with him and the other gatos. 🧡😺
